# Automating Crypto Website API Pull Project

## Project Description
This project automates the retrieval of cryptocurrency data from the CoinMarketCap API, analyzes trends over time, and visualizes the data using Python and popular data analysis libraries. It demonstrates how to work with APIs, process JSON data, and perform data visualization.

## Key Features
- Automated data retrieval from the CoinMarketCap API every minute.
- Data normalization and formatting for easy analysis.
- Historical data storage in CSV format.
- Visualization of cryptocurrency trends over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `requests`: for making API calls.
  - `pandas`: for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib`: for data visualization.
  - `seaborn`: for enhanced data visualization.
- **APIs:** CoinMarketCap API

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automating-Crypto-Website-API-Pull-Project.git
   
2. Install Required Libraries:
pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn

3. Obtain API Key: Sign up at [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to get your API key.

4. Update API Key: Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your actual API key.

5. Run the Script: Execute the script by running:
python your_script.py

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations of cryptocurrency trends over time, which can be found in the output or generated files.

## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into working with APIs and handling cryptocurrency data. Future enhancements could include adding more cryptocurrencies, improving data visualization, or implementing machine learning models for price prediction.
